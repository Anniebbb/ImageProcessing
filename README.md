# About

In this project, I have enhnaced the mammogram images using Laplacian filter and histogram equalization and implemented edge detection using canny edge detection and k-means. 

The original images used are:

# Enhancement

I have converted the images into arrays and convolved them with a 3x3 kernel to obtain the Laplacian of the images. The Laplacian is then subtracted from the images to get the Laplacian filtered images.
